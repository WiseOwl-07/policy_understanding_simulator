# Policy Understanding Simulator - Business Overview

## What is the Policy Understanding Simulator?

The **Policy Understanding Simulator** is an AI-powered application that translates complex insurance policy documents into clear, accessible answers for everyday coverage questions. Think of it as an intelligent assistant that reads insurance policies and explains coverage in plain English—instantly.

### How It Works:
The system uses a **4-agent AI workflow** powered by advanced technologies:

1. **Scenario Interpreter** - Understands what the customer is asking about (asset, event, location)
2. **Policy Selector** - Determines which policy applies (Auto, Property, or Both)
3. **Retrieval Agent** - Searches actual policy documents using semantic AI search (RAG technology)
4. **Explanation Agent** - Generates clear, friendly explanations grounded in real policy language

The result: Customers get accurate answers like **"COVERED"**, **"NOT COVERED"**, or **"IT DEPENDS"** with professional explanations and specific policy citations—all in seconds.
